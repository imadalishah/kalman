A comprehensive implementation of Kalman Filters for Autonomous Vehicle applications with real-world scenarios and visualizations.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **State-of-the-art Implementation**: Robust Kalman Filter designed specifically for autonomous vehicle tracking
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Simulated autonomous driving scenarios including turns, lane changes, and intersections
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Rich visual outputs showing vehicle trajectories, uncertainty estimates, and error analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed analysis of estimation accuracy and filter performance

## 📊 Visual Examples

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/imadalishah/kalman.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd kalman
```

## 💻 Usage

```python
from kalman import KalmanFilterAV

# Initialize the Kalman Filter
kf = KalmanFilterAV(dt=0.1)

# Process measurements
state = kf.predict()
updated_state = kf.update(measurement)
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### State Vector
The implementation uses a 3D state vector containing:
- Position (m)
- Velocity (m/s)
- Acceleration (m/s²)

### System Model
- **State Transition Matrix**:
```python
A = [
    [1, dt, 0.5*dt²],
    [0, 1,  dt     ],
    [0, 0,  1      ]
]
```

- **Measurement Model**: Direct position measurements (e.g., GPS)
- **Noise Models**: Gaussian noise for both process and measurements

## 📈 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| RMSE | 1.26 meters |
| Maximum Error | 3.06 meters |
| Average Update Time | 0.5 ms |

## 🚀 Advanced Features

1. **Multiple Sensor Fusion**
   - GPS
   - IMU
   - Wheel Encoders

2. **Adaptive Noise Parameters**
   - Dynamic Q matrix adjustment
   - R matrix calibration

3. **Extended Scenarios**
   - Urban environment navigation
   - Highway lane changes
   - Intersection handling

## 📚 Theory and Background

The Kalman Filter operates in two steps:
1. **Prediction Step**: Projects the current state forward
2. **Update Step**: Incorporates new measurements

Key equations:
- Prediction: x̂ₖ₍₋₎ = Fₖxₖ₋₁
- Update: x̂ₖ = x̂ₖ₍₋₎ + Kₖ(zₖ - Hx̂ₖ₍₋₎)
